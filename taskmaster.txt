ISAAC: Reach out to Jason regarding time to do motion capture and getting motion capture stickers. Share GIT repo.
        -CSV creation from image data
NOAH: B. Mass process video into arrays of pixels.
EVAN: A.  Detect Region of a color using scatterplot and look for clusters.


Week 8: 5/24-5/31/24
ISAAC: Quicken the ImageToCSV.py,get in touch with Jason
NOAH: Producing CSV from clusters, Change it to output the pixel location info into a file.
EVAN: Clustering 


Week 9: 5/31-6/7
Tasks:
        -Create object to store green pixels and track them
        -Store X and Y coords as different  values as well
        -Process the audio into useful information. https://medium.com/@karthikmandapaka/handling-audio-data-for-machine-learning-7ba225f183cb
                -Pitch and amplitude perhaps?
        -After meeting with Jason start working report of progress completed over the quarter and next steps
        -go in and do sticker recording


-leave audio in raw format potentially

Risk that this has already been done
        -mitigate by getting more niche
        -event cameras
                -less data to process
                -higher_speed
        -do more literature review/think about how to distinguish this
        from other research
        -artifical neural network instead of spiking?

        -generating mesh by directly mapping image might be computationally expensive
        -stickers less resource demanding
        
        -start with regular camera data
        
        -event camera if needed
